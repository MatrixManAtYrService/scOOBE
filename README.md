# Scripted Control of OOBE

This is a collection of small scripts.  Each completes a small OOBE-related task.  The idea is that these would be called by a more comprehensive test automation solution.

## To use

- clone the repo
- cd to the toplevel dir
- `python setup.py develop`
- `press_button 'Pick Language'` # or whatever
